### 🚀 About

I'm a pragmatic architect who delivers real outcomes — not just theory.  
I build SaaS MVPs in 6 weeks, slash cloud OPEX by up to 80%, and refactor legacy systems with zero downtime.  
Results count: 12+ SaaS MVPs live in production, release speed doubled (via CI/CD, automation), and incidents halved through architecture and testing.

- **8+ years experience:** production-grade SaaS since 2016
- **Startup & scaleup accelerator:** from idea to launch & beyond
- **No buzzwords, no chaos:** just architecture that works — business-first, sustainable, measurable
